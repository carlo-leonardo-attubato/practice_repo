# Mock Assessment: Task Queue System

## Overview
Build a task queue system progressively across 4 levels, focusing on job scheduling and priority management.

## Assessment Structure

### Level 1: Basic Task Management (15-20 min)
**Goal**: Core task operations
- Add tasks to queue
- Mark tasks as complete
- Get pending tasks
- Basic task information

### Level 2: Enhanced Queue Features (20-25 min)
**Goal**: Add priority and filtering
- Priority-based task ordering
- Filter tasks by status/priority
- Task search and categorization
- Basic scheduling

### Level 3: Advanced Queue Logic (30-40 min)
**Goal**: Complex scheduling and dependencies
- Task dependencies (prerequisites)
- TTL for tasks (auto-expiration)
- Worker assignment and load balancing
- Retry mechanisms for failed tasks
- Queue statistics and monitoring

### Level 4: System Operations (15-20 min)
**Goal**: Queue management and persistence
- Multiple queue management
- Queue backup/restore
- Batch task operations
- Performance analytics
- Dead letter queue handling

## Key Concepts
- **Priority Queues**: Ordering by importance
- **Task Dependencies**: Prerequisite management
- **Worker Management**: Load distribution
- **Retry Logic**: Handling failures
- **Queue Persistence**: Data durability
