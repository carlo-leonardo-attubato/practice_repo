# Mock Assessment: AI Model Welfare Tracker

## Overview
Build an AI model welfare tracking system progressively across 4 levels. This assessment mirrors Anthropic's focus on AI safety and model welfare monitoring.

## Assessment Structure

### Level 1: Basic Model Registration (15-20 min)
**Goal**: Core model management and interaction logging
- Register AI models with metadata
- Log user interactions with models
- Basic model statistics and queries
- Simple data structures

### Level 2: Interaction Analysis (20-25 min)
**Goal**: Add filtering and interaction pattern analysis
- Filter interactions by time range
- Search interactions by user or model
- Calculate interaction frequencies
- Basic welfare metrics

### Level 3: Welfare Monitoring & Rate Limiting (30-40 min)
**Goal**: Complex welfare tracking and protection mechanisms
- Calculate model "stress" scores based on interaction patterns
- Implement rate limiting per user per model
- Auto-cooldown for overused models
- Welfare alerts and notifications
- Time-window based analysis

### Level 4: Advanced Monitoring & System Management (15-20 min)
**Goal**: System-wide monitoring and data management
- Multi-version model tracking
- System state backup/restore
- Batch welfare operations
- Comprehensive welfare reporting
- Historical trend analysis

## Time Management
- **Total**: 90 minutes
- **Level 1-2**: 25 minutes (get basics working)
- **Level 3**: 50 minutes (focus here for points - welfare logic)
- **Level 4**: 15 minutes (attempt what you can)

## Scoring Strategy
- **Level 1**: ~100 points (basic model management)
- **Level 2**: ~150 points (interaction analysis)
- **Level 3**: ~250 points (welfare monitoring - FOCUS HERE)
- **Level 4**: ~100 points (advanced features)
- **Total**: 600 points (need 520+ to pass)

## Key Concepts
- **Model Welfare**: Tracking how "stressed" models are based on usage
- **Rate Limiting**: Preventing overuse of models
- **Interaction Patterns**: Analyzing user behavior with models
- **Temporal Analysis**: Time-based welfare calculations
- **Cooldown Mechanisms**: Automatic protection for overused models

## Practice Instructions
1. Start with Level 1 - basic model registration and logging
2. Level 2 - add interaction filtering and basic analytics
3. **Focus on Level 3** - implement welfare scoring and rate limiting
4. Level 4 - add system management features if time permits

This assessment tests practical skills relevant to Anthropic's AI safety mission!
