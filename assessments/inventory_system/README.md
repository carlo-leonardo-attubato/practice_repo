# Mock Assessment: Inventory Management System

## Overview
Build an inventory management system progressively across 4 levels, each adding more complexity.

## Assessment Structure

### Level 1: Basic Inventory (15-20 min)
**Goal**: Basic CRUD operations for inventory items
- Add items with ID, name, category, price
- Retrieve items by ID
- List all items
- Simple data structures

### Level 2: Enhanced Features (20-25 min) 
**Goal**: Add filtering and search capabilities
- Filter items by category
- Filter items by price range
- Search items by name (case-insensitive)
- Basic list operations

### Level 3: Stock Management (30-40 min)
**Goal**: Add stock tracking and business logic
- Track item quantities
- Update stock levels
- Low stock alerts
- Total inventory value calculation
- Stock movement history

### Level 4: Advanced Operations (15-20 min)
**Goal**: Add backup/restore and batch operations
- Backup entire inventory
- Restore from backup
- Batch operations (bulk add/update)
- Data validation and error handling
- Export/import functionality

## Time Management
- **Total**: 90 minutes
- **Level 1-2**: 25 minutes (get basics working)
- **Level 3**: 50 minutes (focus here for points)
- **Level 4**: 15 minutes (attempt what you can)

## Scoring Strategy
- **Level 1**: ~100 points (basic functionality)
- **Level 2**: ~150 points (filtering/search)
- **Level 3**: ~250 points (business logic - FOCUS HERE)
- **Level 4**: ~100 points (advanced features)
- **Total**: 600 points (need 520+ to pass)

## Practice Instructions
1. Start with Level 1 - implement basic functionality
2. Move to Level 2 - add filtering
3. Focus heavily on Level 3 - this is where most points are
4. Attempt Level 4 if time permits

**Remember**: Working code beats perfect code!
