# Mock Assessments

This directory contains full practice assessments that simulate the CodeSignal experience.

## Assessment Structure
Each mock assessment follows the 4-level progressive format:
- **Level 1**: Basic functionality (15-20 min)
- **Level 2**: Enhanced features (20-25 min) 
- **Level 3**: Complex operations (30-40 min)
- **Level 4**: Advanced scenarios (15-20 min)

## How to Practice
1. **Set a 90-minute timer** (actual assessment time)
2. **Read ALL levels first** (5 minutes)
3. **Implement progressively** - don't get stuck on perfection
4. **Submit working code** immediately when tests pass
5. **Move forward** even with failures

## Current Mock Assessments
- `inventory_system/` - Product inventory management (coming soon)
- `user_management/` - User data and permissions (coming soon)
- `data_processing/` - CSV parsing and analysis (coming soon)

## Scoring Target
- **Target**: 520+ out of 600 points (87% test cases)
- **Focus**: Level 3 is where most points are earned
- **Strategy**: Speed over elegance, working code over perfect code

## Time Management
- **0-25 min**: Complete Levels 1-2
- **25-65 min**: Focus on Level 3 (critical for points)
- **65-90 min**: Attempt Level 4 with remaining time

Remember: In the real assessment, you can't go back to previous levels once you submit them!
