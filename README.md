```

## Quick Start
1. Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start with speed drills: `python speed_drills/message_store.py`

## Study Plan (19 hours remaining)
- **Tonight**: Foundation building and first mock assessment
- **Tomorrow AM**: Speed pattern memorization and final practice
- **Assessment**: 2 PM deadline

## Key Focus Areas
- Python collections (defaultdict, Counter, deque)
- Dictionary operations and nested structures
- TTL patterns and time-based operations
- CRUD operations (SET/GET/DELETE)
- Progressive problem solving (4-level format)

## Assessment Strategy
- Read ALL levels first (5 min)
- Speed through L1-2 (20 min)
- Focus maximum effort on L3 (50 min)
- Attempt whatever you can of L4 (20 min)
- Target: 520+ out of 600 points (87% test case passage)
