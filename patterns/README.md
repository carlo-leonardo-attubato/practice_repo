# Common Coding Patterns

This directory contains frequently used patterns and data structures for CodeSignal assessments.

## Data Structures
- `collections_usage.py` - defaultdict, Counter, deque examples
- `nested_structures.py` - Complex nested dictionary patterns
- `queue_stack.py` - Queue and stack implementations

## Algorithm Patterns
- `two_pointers.py` - Two pointer technique examples
- `sliding_window.py` - Sliding window algorithm patterns
- `binary_search.py` - Binary search implementations

## Common Operations
- `crud_operations.py` - Create, Read, Update, Delete patterns
- `filtering_sorting.py` - Data filtering and sorting techniques
- `time_operations.py` - Timestamp and TTL handling

## CodeSignal Specific
- `progressive_implementation.py` - How to build up from L1 to L4
- `test_case_handling.py` - Edge case and validation patterns
- `performance_optimization.py` - When to optimize vs. when to ship

## Usage
1. **Study the patterns** before starting drills
2. **Copy-paste templates** during practice (save time)
3. **Customize for specific problems** as needed
4. **Memorize common structures** for speed

## Key Patterns to Master
- `defaultdict(dict)` for nested data
- `Counter` for frequency counting
- `deque` for efficient queue operations
- List comprehensions for filtering
- Dictionary comprehensions for transformations
